A part of CSSBox relies on the CSS Parser open source project
(http://cssparser.sourceforge.net/). An unmodified snaphsot from its CVS which is tested
with CSSBox is provided in the distribution as a jar file.

In the demo applications, the jTidy parser (http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/)
is used for creating the HTML DOM tree. An official snapshot is included in this distribution
as a jar file.

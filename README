All the source code of the CSSBox itself is licensed under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL), version 3. A copy of the LGPL can be found 
in the COPYING.LESSER and COPYING files.

CSSBox relies on the jStyleParser open source CSS parser 
(http://cssbox.sourceforge.net/jstyleparser). A snaphsot from its SVN which is tested
with this CSSBox version is provided in the distribution as a jar file. See the
jStyleParser documentation for the additional dependencies.

Any DOM and DOM Traversal implementation can be used as an input of the layout engine.
In the demos contained in the org.fit.cssbox.demo package, the NekoHTML parser 
(http://nekohtml.sourceforge.net/) is used for creating the DOM tree. An official 
release of this parser is included in this distribution as a .jar file.
